# FastEP ⚡️🏢

Surrogate EnergyPlus models for fast building energy optimization.

## 🚀 Overview

FastEP is a project focused on fast building energy optimization. Its goal is to train surrogate models based on EnergyPlus simulations. FastEP enables the generation, training, and evaluation of models that accurately simulate building energy behavior, significantly accelerating optimization and analysis without the need to run full EnergyPlus simulations.
